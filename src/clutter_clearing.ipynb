To assemble this into a full-stack manipulation system, we need to specify the timing semantics of when those functions are called.  That's precisely what Drake's systems framework provides.  I've introduced the systems below: \n","- `GraspSelector` system that takes the camera inputs and outputs the desired grasp, \n","- `Planner` system that takes this pose estimate (and the state of the robot), computes the trajectory, and stores that trajectory in its Context so that it can output the instantaneous command.  This system also keeps track of a `mode` ; the logical state of task execution.\n","\n","I've made only a modest attempt to make this robust.  Enough to show you some of the task-level planning logic, but not enough to work every time.  If things go sideways, then go ahead and hit ESCAPE and rerun the sim.\n","\n","It's fun to think about the remaining limitations.  I would group them into:\n","1. MultibodyPlant can crash; almost always during at time almost zero, if my simple random initial conditions strategy puts objects in deep penetration\n","2. Motion planning. Sometimes it runs into the cameras, knocks the objects into the bins, or gets itself wound up into an unfortunate state for Differential IK.\n","3. Perception. Since there is no notion of object here, our simple grasp selection strategy can pick objects up at the edges or make double-picks.  (Sometimes the gripper gets itself in the point cloud, and the grasp selector picks a candidate grasp on the robot itself, resulting in an apparent airball!  That one is silly and could be fixed with only a little more work)\n","4. More than pick and place. Sometimes objects get stuck in the corners, for instance, and we really need strategies other than pure grasping to get them out.\n","\n","We'll address these pretty soundly in the next few chapters!\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Press Escape to stop the simulation\n","Planned 25.935597160577004 second trajectory in mode PlannerState.PICKING_FROM_X_BIN at time 1.1.\n","Planned 26.78298902335439 second trajectory in mode PlannerState.PICKING_FROM_X_BIN at time 27.1.\n","Planned 29.087381706298046 second trajectory in mode PlannerState.PICKING_FROM_X_BIN at time 53.900000000000006.\n","Planned 27.569264827422387 second trajectory in mode PlannerState.PICKING_FROM_X_BIN at time 83.0.\n","Planned 30.44483876877119 second trajectory in mode PlannerState.PICKING_FROM_X_BIN at time 110.60000000000001.\n"]}],"source":["\n","def build_stacking_diagram():\n","    builder = DiagramBuilder()\n","\n","    model_directives = \"\"\"\n","directives:\n","- add_directives:\n","    file: package://manipulation/clutter_w_cameras.dmd.yaml\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","    for i in range(10 if running_as_notebook else 2):\n","        object_num = rs.randint(len(ycb))\n","        if \"cracker_box\" in ycb[object_num]:\n","            #
